SPM (Simple Project Management)
===============================

NOTE: THIS PROJECT DOES NOT HAVE CSRF PROTECTIONS!!!!!!!!
REASON: SHMEH. TOO MUCH WORK AS WE ARE USING THIS JUST INTERNALLY.. MOSTLY
        AND DON'T REALLY CARE IF YOU STEAL OUR MOSTLY OPEN DATA ANYWAY

This project is also fairly hacked together.. so yeah..
It looks pretty good, though :D

To run the development setup. You need: 

 - Riakkit with self-ref support: 
   Clone git://github.com/shuhaowu/riakkit.git and merge the self-ref
   branch into your master branch. Symlink that into this directory or
   install it with self-ref support
 - Coffeecrispt: git://github.com/shuhaowu/coffeecrispt.git
   Link the crispt script into your PATH, this way you can just use the 
   command.

Compile the javascript:

    crispt -i coffeedev/ -o static/javascripts/app.js

Add `-w` if you're modifying to watch for changes and auto compile

Run the server: `python run.py`

Go to `http://localhost:4131` to see the result.
